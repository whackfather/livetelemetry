# Live Telemetry

This repository contains code meant to go on Adafruit RP2040 RFM95 radio transmission boards. Most of these scripts were not originally written and are instead either directly from the Adafruit website or are a combination of different scripts from the Adafruit website. This is simply a place for me to dump the scripts I will be using.
